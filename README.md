# Google-Stock-Price-Predicition-Challenge
 
 
## Summary
An RNN based deep learning algorithm that can be used to predict stock price of any major companies.
It has been trained on Google’s stock price data from last 5 years to predict Google’s future stock price and based on Time-Series-Analysis using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). 

This network basically works by using an ordered time series data, that is stock data of past dates coupled together in sequential order, to predict the stock price of the next date. This network uses very simple features, and acts as a simple proof-of-concept. Many more complex features can be created, major stock broker which use AI based stock trading algorithms use hundreds of different features for their algorithms.
